            From my own perception and also humble request to you when you asked to say something about 
            our problem in class, Please record this session when you are solving that individual problem because
            one individual solution may be helpful for the rest of the students. Also 
            someone may face same problem sooner or later. And your concrete solution will be helpful at that
            time. 
            
        </p>
        <p>
            Firstly, we have to create a database with table. And creating every table column and row will 
            depend on Form field and required fields. As we created a form to take user input, which will send 
            action page ("store.php") after submitting the button. In second steps, the user input data will 
            exist in "store.php" page. According our necessity we will call individual method to send our user
            input data to be inserted.
            
            To insert our data firstly, we will connect with database then link with database table. Then we will
            create a query to store in database. After creating query it will store and page will be redirected in
            view page to show what we have stored so far. 
            
            Before redirecting in index page we will test the procedure whether it is working or not by taking 
            help from Utility method . If it's ok then we will redirect thorough Utility::redirect(); method. 
            
            Now we will see our storing data in a scattering way. Also we will not see the whole storing data in
            index page. 
            
            To see the whole data in organizing way, now we will call another method from index page.
            After calling method firstly, we will connect with database and table. Then we will create a query  
            to select all data from database table. After selecting if we "var_dump()" that query, we will see a
            single data from table but not all. TO see all data we will run a "while loop" so that it will show
            us all data from table. After running a "while loop" we will store all data in a array then return to 
            index page to be shown. 
            
            Now we will be seeing  all table data in scattering way if we "var_dump()" here. If we want to see all
            data in table row then we will 
            run "foreach()" loop before table row tag. Here we will create "foreach()" loop inside php tag. and 
            inside every table row we will create php tag to "echo" so that we can dynamically see all of data
            inside of table row. 
            
            PROBLEM I FACED: I faced the following problem.
